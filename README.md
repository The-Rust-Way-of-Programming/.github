Write a Rust programming book in English, dedicated to Rust-loving friends around the world.

Nowadays, many Rust programming learning materials are written for people who have a certain foundation in programming. This book is an attempt and a challenge to be oriented towards zero programming foundation without losing its depth of content, and to inspire developers with certain Rust programming experience.
